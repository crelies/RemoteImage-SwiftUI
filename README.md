# RemoteImage-SwiftUI

Remote Image view with error and loading state for SwiftUI

## Motivation

I wanted to have a simple and extendable remote image view in **SwiftUI** which takes care of all the magic
(image loading, caching, error and loading view). At my current employer we used a custom **UIKit** view for that.

## Preview

Coming soon ...
